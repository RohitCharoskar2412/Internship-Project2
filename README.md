Gold Price Detection
letâ€™s use machine learning regression techniques to predict the price of one of the most important precious metal, the Gold.

We will create a machine learning linear regression model that takes information from the past Gold ETF (GLD) prices and returns a prediction of the Gold ETF price the next day.

GLD is the largest ETF to invest directly in physical gold.
